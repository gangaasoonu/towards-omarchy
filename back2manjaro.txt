switching off WiFi is key, I some how am unable to use the TUI in Omarchy...

swicthing between kannada & english input is tuff .. locale-gen isn't just happening. ven with Ibus installed, I can't Kannada input in fcitx5

It all takes 4-5 seconds longer on Omarchy
Login Prompt
post password typing, Screen to load
Terminal ...
Chromium to load

& Hyprland, .... I've been used to XFCE

So, for now, not yet ready for Omarchy.
